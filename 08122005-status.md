UI is a mess, I call it button-city
- perhaps menu, but I didn't want to spend time with that before  https://github.com/computerscienceiscool/collab-editor-notes/blob/main/menu_structure.md 
- perhaps keyboard short cuts https://github.com/computerscienceiscool/collab-editor-notes/blob/main/keyboard-shortcuts.md 
- Maybe leave a few features available.

Family stuff, trying to get feeding tube for parent...  hustling, calling and getting people to want to help me...is this sales?  :\  

Spent SO much time trying to get Mark's SST working.... oh no.  I felt like  I spent an entire day downloading and an entire day to try it.  I was not successful.  The Moby Dick sample was the one I tried.
